Model Switching Logic:

Auto-select based on cost, speed, accuracy

Allow per-agent model choice

Fine-tuning & Embeddings:

Domain-specific knowledge injection

Vector DB (Pinecone / Weaviate / ChromaDB)

Agent Architecture

Core Components:

Memory module (short-term & long-term)

Tool-calling / function-calling capabilities

Multi-step reasoning chain

Specialized Templates:

Customer support bot

Research bot

Scheduling assistant

Workflow automation agent

2.2 No-Code Agent Builder
